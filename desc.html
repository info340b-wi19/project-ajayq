        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            The problem that I want to tackle is the problem of parking in Seattle. The biggest 
            problem with parking in Seattle is being able to reliably find cheap parking on the 
            streets of Seattle. Currently street parking is incredibly inconvenient to find, pretty
            much the only way to find it are by happening upon a free spot as one drives around. 
            This is not only hard on the person that is doing the searching, but it can actually 
            become hazardous to them and the people around them. Searching for spots can be 
            distracting for the driver, and it can also make them drive slower which can contribute
            to traffic within the area. The only other option in these scenarios are submitting to 
            an overpriced parking lot, if there even is one that is open. Currently there is no way
            to find out better information about where one could find street parking. However, 
            there is an application endorsed by the Seattle government called 
            <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/parking-program/paid-parking-information/pay-on-your-phone">PayByPhone</a> 
            which allows people to: 
            <ul>
                <li>Remotely extend parking session by paying through their phone app.</li>
                <li>Get textmessage reminders of when their time is about to end.</li>
                <li>Kepp track of receipts for travel, parking locations, and other things.</li>
            </ul>
            There are also other separate applications that one could find online such as 
            <a href="https://www.parkme.com/seattle-parking">ParkMe</a>. These kinds of websites
            allow people to reserve parking spots at different locations around Seattle's downtown
            area. However the issue with this website is that the parking spots are not only sparse
            but they are also more expensive (some more than others) than street parking in the same
            area.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            The app that I will create will be one that takes the information that the government
            has regarding whether or not meters still have minutes on them to make an informed
            guess of whether or not a certain spot is in use or not. I would cater my app towards 
            anyone who uses street parking within Seattle on a regular basis. One group of
            individuals who this might be especially helpful for are carriers, whether that be 
            people who work for postmates or package/ message carriers. However this would also 
            be helpful to anyone who is not as familiar with Seattle's downtown area as they might
            be very anxious in this new environment and this would relieve that kind of pressure.
            Though this might not eliminate the search for spots on the street it could drastically 
            improve people's experience with finding parking in downtown.
        </p>
        <h3>App Functionality</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The application would open up and ask the user for their desired destination
                within Seattle. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Then the application would jump to a map of the location and surrounding areas.
                This would display many dots within the map that represent all of the parking 
                meters. Dots that are lit up would represent the meters that currently do not have
                any money in them indicating that they are most likely vacant. Certain larger 
                sections of the map may be lit up indicating that there are many meters within that
                section that are free. 
            </li>
            <li>
                After the user has scrolled around the map and found ether a specific meter or a 
                section that they wished to set as their destination they can click on their desired
                location. This would then send open up google maps sending them to that specific 
                location.
            </li>
        </ol>
