This is our  Web application QuickStops.
The purpose for our web application is to help people find interesting stops in locations that they might be unfamiliar with.
For example if someone is stuck waiting in a new area, then they can use our application to find a better way to spend their time.

How to use our app:
1. Sign in to use the application 
2. Allow the application to see your location or search a new location.
3. Hover over the shown markers to see if there may be something interesting in that area.
4. Once you've found one you like, click on the marker for more information!
5. If you liked that business, save the business for later! 
6. Wanna see all your favorited businesses? Head over to the Saved tab to find reviews and more about it!
